The spread of social media has far-reaching implications for both the practice and the study of public relations as well as related fields such as marketing. What I&#8217;d like to focus on here is the _dynamization_ of public relations. By &#8220;dynamizing&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean the popular definition of &#8220;energizing&#8221; public relations or making it &#8220;exciting.&#8221; Rather, I mean this in the strictest mathematical sense of making the public relations &#8220;dynamic&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;static.&#8221;

What does this entail? The primary implication is that we should seek to understand an organization&#8217;s public relations efforts as a day-to-day, continual process. Static models, in contrast, provide a point-in-time snapshot of an organization&#8217;s efforts. Snapshots are useful but only insofar as they help&#8230;

A dynamic model, in contrast, allows us to get at _change over time._ 

So, dynamic models explicitly incorporate the time dimension. This opens up numerous avenues of research, including time-series analysis.
