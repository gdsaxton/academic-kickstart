Twitter is not the Gutenberg Press. The &#8216;Big Data&#8217; revolution is over-hyped. Nevertheless, Twitter is significant in a number of ways:

  * <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For identifying trends.</span>
  * For rapid, near real-time dissemination of news.
  * It has been used to track the progression of the flu and other infectious diseases.
  * It has played a mobilizational role in the Arab Spring and other social movement activities.
  * For on-the-ground reporting of news and events.
  * It allows you to decentralize research; what Nigel Cameron calls _<a href="http://nigelcameron.wordpress.com/future/why-twitter-matters/" target="_blank">mutual curation</a> _and others call _social curation._
  * For looking into the global <a href="http://nigelcameron.wordpress.com/future/why-twitter-matters/" target="_blank">cocktail party</a> that is Twitter.
  * Allows one to take the pulse of the community on almost any given topic.
  * <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Twitter is </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">the </em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Big Data source.</span>
  * It constitutes a coordination and communication tool for post-disaster mobilizations.
  * Twitter facilitates the rapid diffusion of ideas, rumors, opinion, sentiment, and news.
  * For professionals and organizations alike, it facilitates _networking_, _relationship-building, _and _exposure._
  * Twitter is proving to be a powerful _dialogic_ tool &#8212; for initiating and engaging in conversations.
  * Unlike other social media (e.g., Facebook), Twitter has a largely <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/08/12/the-strength-of-weak-ties-why-twitter-matters-in-scholarly-communication/" target="_blank"><i>open</i> model</a>, allowing anyone to follow anyone else.
  * _Social chatter_ has become a powerful tool for 
      * <a href="http://www.brandwatch.com/2011/12/hedge-funds-capitalising-on-social-chatter/" target="_blank">Hedge fund managers</a> listen in on social media conversations in making their decisions.
      * Tracking and identifying terrorists and extremists.
  * Facilitates the leveraging of what Granovetter (1973) calls _weak ties._
  * Can be a force for good (e.g., <a href="http://twestival.com/" target="_blank"><em>Twestivals</em></a>).

In short, Twitter is not just for sharing pictures of your lunch. In addition to all the silliness, Twitter has come to be the world&#8217;s premier _message __network._ It These messages are used in a wide variety of settings and for a broad range of purposes. And r<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">esearchers are able to listen in &#8212; a boon to anyone interested in messages, conversations, networks, information, mobilization, diffusion, or any number of social science phenomena.</span>
