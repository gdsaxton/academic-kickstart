I often get requests to explain how I obtained the data I used in a particular piece of academic research. I am always happy to share my code along with my data. Having been through the learning process myself about 5 years ago, I understand the confusion and frustration that can go along with learning a programming language. There are a number of new concepts going on all at once, which can make it difficult to wrap your head around. 

For this reason, I have created a number of tutorials. In the table below I list all of these tutorials to date. They are designed primarily for the user who is a complete neophyte to computer programming, though intermediate and some advanced users may find some of the actual code helpful. For those of you who are new to Python, I recommend going through these tutorials in order. Each introduces only one or two new concepts at a time, which will make the learning process easier. 

I should also mention that the focus of these tutorials is for those who want to download and analyze Twitter data. For social media researchers this is the best place to start. After you are comfortable with that then it is easier to branch out to studying Facebook and other social media platforms.  [table id=3 /] &nbsp;</p> 

I hope this helps. Happy coding!
