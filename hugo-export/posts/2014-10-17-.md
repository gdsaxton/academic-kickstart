At its core, attention is an informational concept, based, as it is, on how well information is processed. As a result, given that organizational efforts tend to follow the resources, attention philanthropy broadly entails greater emphasis on informational—and, in the process, communication-centered—practices in the organization: stakeholder relations, public relations, marketing, accountability, fundraising. Budgeting, volunteering, training, and program evaluation are less communication centered and thus receive less emphasis. At the same time, each of these organizational functions tends to become more focused on attention and hence driven by communication. For instance, in an advocacy organization, advocacy campaigns shift to hashtag activism and public education campaigns at the expense of, say, judicial advocacy or administrative lobbying. All functions similarly become more communicative and informational in their orientation. So, advocacy becomes more communicative and message based; accountability shifts to greater emphasis on demonstration of accountability, and so on.

Notes:

  * This ties in with Jane’s comment on prior page. What we’ve done in the paragraph that straddles this and the prior page is summarize the effect on organizations and then on projects and programs. Namely, that within the sector, attention shifts to more “attention-friendly” organizations, and within organizations, attention shifts to more “attention-friendly” projects and programs. 
  * Now, the point we’re making in this paragraph here is that, within organizations, attention will shift to more “attention-friendly” functions (such as marketing), and within each function, efforts will shift toward the most “attention-friendly” aspects of it. 
  * So, perhaps we could say, “For instance, advocacy organizations generally resort to a dozen or so broad advocacy tactics, some of which – say, public education – are more communication-centered than others (e.g., judicial advocacy, administrative lobbying). We find that, with attention philanthropy, advocacy campaigns will tend to shift to hashtag activism and….”
  * And with accountability, what we were (only implicitly) saying was that accountability-related activities will shift toward communicating accountability as opposed to other features of accountability (such as acting in stakeholders’ interests). Transparency and communication and dialogues are important dimensions of accountability but not everything. And an organization that shifts its accountability efforts to the demonstration of accountability (or the communication of accountability efforts) will be focusing less on other important dimensions.
