I have published over 40 articles on accounting analytics, nonprofit organizations, Big Data, communication, and information technology in the premier journals in political science (_British Journal of Political Science_), communication (_Journal of Communication_), public administration (_Public Administration Review_), nonprofit studies (_Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly_), accounting (_Accounting, Organizations and Society_), and business ethics (_Journal of Business Ethics_).

Below is a list of my peer-reviewed journal publications. I&#8217;ve included links to publisher versions for each article as well as a link to the pre-print versions available at <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1100547" target="_blank">SSRN</a> or <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregory_Saxton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResearchGate</a>.

        We posit a key goal of firms&#8217; corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts is to influence reputation through carefully crafted communicative practices. This trend has accelerated with the rise of social media such as Twitter and Facebook, which are essentially public message networks that organizations are leveraging to engage with concerned audiences. Given the large number of messages sent on these sites, only some will be effective and achieve broad public resonance. Building on signaling theory, this paper asks whether and how messages conveying CSR-related topics resonate with the public and, if so, which CSR topics and signal qualities are most effective. We test our hypotheses using data on public reactions to Fortune 500 companies&#8217; CSR-focused Twitter feeds, using the retweeting (sharing) of firms&#8217; messages as a proxy for public resonance. We find resonance is positively associated with messages that convey CSR topics such as the environment or education, those that make the topic explicit through use of hashtags, and those that tap into existing social movement discussions.

        Nonprofits use social media to pursue a broad range of mission-related outcomes. Given the centrality of user connections and social networks on these sites, attaining these outcomes is contingent on first generating a stock of online social capital through investing in online relationships. Yet, little is known empirically about this process. To better understand the return on social media, this study develops empirical measures of four key dimensions of social media–based social capital centering on the nature of nonprofits&#8217; network positions and stakeholder ties. The study then tests a series of hypotheses relating the increase in social capital to different types of stakeholder engagement tactics. Using Twitter data on 198 community foundations, the study finds that content with multiple communication cues and intersectoral stakeholder targeting predict higher levels of social capital; communicative and stakeholder diversity, thus, appear to play a key role in the successful organizational use of social media.

        The social media era ushers in an increasingly &#8220;noisy&#8221; information environment that renders it more difficult for nonprofit advocacy organizations to make their voices heard. How then can an organization gain attention on social media? We address this question by building and testing a model of the effectiveness of the Twitter use of advocacy organizations. Using number of retweets and number of favorites as proxies of attention, we test our hypotheses with a 12-month panel dataset that collapses by month and organization the 219,915 tweets sent by 145 organizations in 2013. We find that attention is strongly associated with the size of an organization&#8217;s network, its frequency of speech, and the number of conversations it joins. We also find a seemingly contradictory relationship between different measures of attention and an organization&#8217;s targeting and connecting strategy.

        The current study examines the micro-linguistic details of Twitter responses to the whistleblower-initiated publication of the Panama Papers. The leaked documents contained the micro-details of tax avoidance, tax evasion, and wealth accumulation schemes used by business elites, politicians, and government bureaucrats. The public release of the documents on April 4, 2016 resulted in a groundswell of Twitter and other social media activity throughout the world, including 161,036 Spanish-language tweets in the subsequent 5-month period. The findings illustrate that the responses were polyvocal, consisting a collection of overlapping speech genres with varied thematic topics and linguistic styles, as well as differing degrees of calls for action and varying amounts of illocutionary force. The analysis also illustrates that, while the illocutionary force of tweets is somewhat associated with the adoption of a prosaic and vernacular ethical stance as well as with demands for action, these types of voicing behaviors were not present in the majority of the tweets. These results suggest that, while social media platforms are a popular site for collective forms of voicing activities, it is less certain that these collective stakeholder voices necessarily result in forceful accountability demands that spill out of the communication medium and thus serve as an impulse for positive social change.

        In an increasingly overloaded information environment sparked by the explosion of digital media, the ability to curate content has taken on greater importance. This study begins with the supposition that businesses that are able to adopt a content curation role and help consumers sort through the daily influx of information may be more successful in attracting, engaging, and retaining customers while fostering brand awareness and word of mouth. Accordingly, this study investigates organizational marketing strategies on Pinterest, the fifth most popular U.S. social media site and the largest social curation platform. Pinterest effectively offers a unique opportunity for businesses to engage customers through social curation strategies, and in this paper we set out to address two related questions. First, how are organizations communicating with current and potential customers on Pinterest? And second, how effective are these strategies? We address these questions by inductively analyzing 1,095 &#8220;pins&#8221; sent by 18 cosmetic surgery businesses. Undertaking analyses at the pin, board, and account levels, we ultimately identify three distinct pinning strategies: Lifestyle, Information Source, and Market Creator. These strategies are then related to the effectiveness of brand awareness and word of mouth, using the number of repins as the primary measure of &#8220;reach&#8221; of a marketing campaign. The Lifestyle strategy had the biggest impact, generating the largest number of repins. The implications of these social curation strategies for social media marketing are explored.

        With the rapid proliferation and adoption of social media among healthcare professionals and organizations, social media-based HIV/AIDS intervention programs have become increasingly popular. However, the question of the effectiveness of the HIV/AIDS messages disseminated on social media has received scant attention in the literature. The current study applies content analysis to examine the relationship between Facebook messaging strategies employed by 110 HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations and audience reactions in the form of liking, commenting, and sharing behavior. The results reveal that HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations often use informational messages as one-way communication with their audience instead of dialogic interactions. Some specific types of messages, such as medication-focused messages, engender better audience engagement; in contrast, event-related messages and call-to-action messages appear to translate into lower corresponding audience reactions. The findings provide guidance to HIV/AIDS organizations in developing effective social media communication strategies.

Abstract = {With the rapid proliferation and adoption of social media among healthcare professionals and organizations, social media-based HIV/AIDS intervention programs have become increasingly popular. However, the question of the effectiveness of the HIV/AIDS messages disseminated on social media has received scant attention in the literature. The current study applies content analysis to examine the relationship between Facebook messaging strategies employed by 110 HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations and audience reactions in the form of liking, commenting, and sharing behavior. The results reveal that HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations often use informational messages as one-way communication with their audience instead of dialogic interactions. Some specific types of messages, such as medication-focused messages, engender better audience engagement; in contrast, event-related messages and call-to-action messages appear to translate into lower corresponding audience reactions. The findings provide guidance to HIV/AIDS organizations in developing effective social media communication strategies.},

        This paper develops an endogenous model of institutional and professional domain change. Traditional accounts of domain change focus attention on how professional expertise is extended to new areas of practice. This form of domain extension is typically both deliberate and contested. However, domain change can also occur in a somewhat quotidian and uncontested fashion when professional expertise is extended intra-organizationally. We analyze the ways in which the domain of accounting expertise is being reconstituted in new social media &#8211; Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter &#8211; in Big 4 accounting firms. Using content analysis and interview data we show how social media professionals, in pursuing their own professional project, generate change in the domain of accountancy. Our analysis demonstrates that the institutional work of domain change occurs through three related activities; boundary work, rhetorical work and the construction of the embedded actor.

        Nonprofit organizations face intense competition in the market for &#8220;investors&#8221; – donors who are willing to finance the organization&#8217;s social output. Increasingly, donation decisions are made online, and organizations have responded by implementing substantive Internet disclosure and reporting regimes. We posit here that the voluntary disclosure of financial and performance information inherent in these regimes provides additional relevant information to market participants, and thus has a positive impact on the receipt of charitable contributions. We test our hypotheses on two samples of US nonprofit organizations by building on the well established &#8220;economic model of giving&#8221; (Weisbrod & Dominguez, 1986), which has donations serving as the proxy for demand. Our central research question is thus: Are donors willing to &#8220;pay&#8221; for Web disclosure? Results indicate a positive relationship between the level of charitable contributions and the amount of financial- and performance-related disclosure provided by an organization on its website; however, conditions dictate whether performance or financial disclosure dominates. The results suggest web disclosures are value relevant in the market for charitable contributions.

        Though public relations scholarship has often discussed the possibilities of dialogue and engagement using social media, research has not truly explored this dynamic. Instead, research on social media platforms has focused on measuring the content and structure of organizational profiles. This study seeks to enhance the field&#8217;s discussion about social media engagement by determining what organizational content individual stakeholders prefer on Facebook in terms of liking, commenting, and sharing. A content analysis of 1,000 updates from organizations on the Nonprofit Times 100 list indicates that, based on what they comment on and &#8220;like,&#8221; individuals prefer dialogic as well as certain forms of mobilizational messages; however, they are more likely to share one-way informational messages with their own networks. These findings are interpreted using practical and theoretical implications for the practice of public relations.

        This paper aims to examine what type of messaging on Twitter is most effective for helping move social marketing beyond focusing on personal changes to find out what messages help turn members of the public into vocal advocates for these organizations&#8217; social changes. Social marketing scholarship has regularly focused on how organizations can effectively influence changes in awareness and behaviors among their targeted audience. Communication scholarship, however, has repeatedly shown that the most influential form of persuasion happens interpersonally. As such, it is imperative that organizations learn how to engage audiences and facilitate the discussion about organizational messages between individuals. Social media provide platforms for such conversations, as organizational messaging can be shared and discussed by individuals with others in their networks.

        This study examines what drives organizational adoption and use of social media through a model built around four key factors – strategy, capacity, governance and environment. Using Twitter, Facebook, and other data on 100 large US nonprofit organizations, the model is employed to examine the determinants of three key facets of social media utilization: (1) adoption, (2) frequency of use and (3) dialogue. We find that organizational strategies, capacities, governance features and external pressures all play a part in these social media adoption and utilization outcomes. Through its integrated, multi-disciplinary theoretical perspective, this study thus helps foster understanding of which types of organizations are able and willing to adopt and juggle multiple social media accounts, to use those accounts to communicate more frequently with their external publics, and to build relationships with those publics through the sending of dialogic messages.

        The information organizations choose to disclose is a strategic consideration. The &#8220;success&#8221; of strategic disclosure is contingent in turn on the target audience&#8217;s values and preferences. The disclosure of and reaction to organizational information thus involves a strategic interaction between the producer and consumer of the information, yet prior communication research has focused on only one side or the other of this equation. In response, we examine organization-public interactions in a domain with key, measurable outcomes –- the charitable donations marketplace –- and propose a game-theoretic explanation of organizational disclosures and individual donations. The study specifically emphasizes two core donor preferences –- the desire for impact and the desire for publicity –- with donors choosing between organizations based on how well the organization satisfies these preferences. Organizations&#8217; optimal level of disclosure, in turn, depends on their own &#8220;type&#8221; and the types of donors they attract. This study recommends organizations think of their disclosure and efficiency-related decisions as conveying valuable, yet distinct, information to two ideal-types of prospective donors: the impact maximizer and the publicity maximizer. Mapping and targeting the &#8220;right&#8221; mix of donors is a key managerial decision that ultimately impacts both the organization&#8217;s financial outcomes and donor&#8217;s satisfaction with the donation experience.

        One hundred forty characters seems like too small a space for any meaningful information to be exchanged, but Twitter users have found creative ways to get the most out of each Tweet by using different communication tools. This paper looks into how 73 nonprofit organizations use Twitter to engage stakeholders not only through their tweets, but also through other various communication methods. Specifically, it looks into the organizations&#8217; utilization of tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, retweets, and multimedia files. After analyzing 4,655 tweets, the study found that the nation&#8217;s largest nonprofits are not using Twitter to maximize stakeholder involvement. Instead, they continue to use social media as a one-way communication channel, as less than 20% of their total tweets demonstrate conversations and roughly 16% demonstrate indirect connections to specific users.

        Encouraging organizations to be more open has been a key issue in contemporary debates over nonprofit accountability. However, our understanding of what motivates organizations to the disclosure decision is weak. We aim to enhance our understanding of this critical issue by developing and testing a model of the determinants of voluntary disclosure decision making, using data gathered on the population of not-for-profit medical institutions in Taiwan during a period where the government encouraged –- but did not require –- disclosure on a centralized website. As a result, we are able to conduct a &#8220;natural experiment&#8221; of the voluntary disclosure behavior of an important population of non-donor-dependent organizations. We find voluntary disclosure is more likely in organizations that are smaller, have lower debt/asset ratios, and are run by larger boards with more inside members. Our data suggest that, from a policy perspective, voluntary disclosure regimes are not an especially effective means of promoting public accountability.

        Nonprofit organizations are increasingly using Internet-based technologies to address accountability. This article presents a set of conceptual, theoretical, and empirical innovations to help understand this phenomenon. First, this article presents a conceptual framework that delineates two key dimensions of Web-based accountability practices: disclosure and dialogue. It then posits a four-factor explanatory model of online accountability incorporating organizational strategy, capacity, governance, and environment. Last, it tests the model through a content analysis of 117 U.S. community foundation Web sites combined with survey and financial data. The descriptive statistics show that the Web site has been more effectively used to provide financial and performance disclosures than to provide dialogic mechanisms for stakeholder input and interactive engagement. Our multivariate analyses, in turn, highlight capacity- and governance-related variables, especially asset size and board performance, as the most significant factors associated with the adoption of Web-based accountability practices.

        Charitable giving is one of the essential tasks of a properly functioning civil society. This task is greatly complicated by the lack of organizational transparency and by the information asymmetries that often exist between organizations and donors in the market for charitable donations. The disclosure of financial, performance, donor-relations, and fundraising-related data is thus an important tool for nonprofit organizations attempting to attract greater donations while boosting accountability and public trust. There are, however, varying payoffs associated with such disclosure depending on the nature of donor preferences and the relative openness and effectiveness of competing organizations. To help understand the interplay between nonprofit organizational disclosures and individual donations, we present a novel game-theoretic model of disclosure – donation interactions that incorporates the predominant forms of both donor preferences and &#8220;value-relevant&#8221; information.

        The political expression of ethnopolitical communities spans three primary forms – electoral party politics, social movement protest behaviour, and violent rebellion. Previous literature, however, has studied these three strategies in isolation from one another. Using new data on the 17 autonomous communities of Spain, we test the ability of a prevailing model of ethnopolitical conflict (Gurr 1993a, 1993b, 2000) to account for the full range of regional nationalist political behaviour. This design effectively permits us to ask a central question: what incites nations to move from one type of contention to another? The findings confirm that, as the configuration of motivating factors in a community changes, organizations acting within that community do respond to the altered incentives and changing political context by moving up and down the `ladder of contention&#8217;. The findings thus suggest an under-explored `strategic dynamism&#8217; in force in ethnonational communities. In capturing this dynamic movement, our framework allows for a better understanding of which features of a group&#8217;s environment tend to have an `escalatory&#8217; impact on conflict (especially repression), and which others have a generally `ameliorative&#8217; effect (e.g., economic transfers).

Using new data on the 17 autonomous communities of Spain, we test the ability of a prevailing model of ethnopolitical conflict (Gurr 1993a, 1993b, 2000) to account for the full range of regional nationalist political behaviour. This design effectively permits us to ask a central question: what incites nations to move from one type of contention to another? The findings confirm that, as the configuration of motivating factors in a community changes, organizations acting within that community do respond to the altered incentives and changing political context by moving up and down the `ladder of contention'. The findings thus suggest an under-explored `strategic dynamism' in force in ethnonational communities. In capturing this dynamic movement, our framework allows for a better understanding of which features of a group's environment tend to have an `escalatory' impact on conflict (especially repression), and which others have a generally `ameliorative' effect (e.g., economic transfers).},

        How do participatory constituent practices affect the scope and intensity of nonprofit advocacy? In this exploratory study, we empirically examine this question through the use of survey data from a random sample of charitable nonprofit organizations in Arizona in 2007. Our findings show that the scope and intensity of nonprofit advocacy tend to increase with constituent board membership, communication with constituents, and level of constituent involvement in strategic decision making, yet decrease with the growth in government funding and private contributions. These findings suggest important implications for organizations wishing to be more effective in influencing public policy.

        Building on the most important theoretical tools from the literatures on social movements and nationalism, we propose a model of the intensity of nationalist political behavior in which a community&#8217;s means, motives, and opportunities assume the central roles in the initiation and escalation of nationalist contentious politics. We then test this model using multinomial logit on original data from the seventeen autonomous communities of Spain over a twenty-year period. The results demonstrate that the means, motives, and opportunities assume vital, yet nonlinear, roles in determining a community&#8217;s level of electoral, violent, and nonviolent contentious activity. The findings also show that there are crucial differences in what accounts for the moves to electoral contention, to protest, and to rebellion. Several of these factors are uniformly escalatory on the intensity of contention?especially repression, social mobilization, and regime change?while others, most importantly democracy, have a moderating effect on the generation of conflict. The results further imply processes of a diffusion of rebellious activities and of an organizational-level substitution effect between violent and nonviolent forms of political behavior. At the aggregate community level, however, escalation in contention involves a ?cumulative effect? rather than a classic ?substitution effect.?

        How are nonprofits using information technology (IT) to enhance mission-related outcomes and boost organizational performance? In this paper we examine large-scale survey data of nonprofits&#8217; technology planning, acquisition, and implementation to assess the strategic use of IT in these organizations. We further evaluate their strategic technology-use potential through an examination of those IT-related competencies and practices that the literature deems critical for the successful strategic employment of technology resources. We find several promising developments alongside significant deficits in the strategic utilization of IT, especially in the areas of financial sustainability, strategic communications and relationship-building, and collaborations and partnerships. To boost IT&#8217;s mission-related impact, nonprofits will have to enhance their organizational capacities in long-term IT planning; budgeting, staffing, and training; performance measurement; Internet and website capabilities; and the vision, support, and involvement of senior management. Accordingly, we end with recommendations for overcoming some of the most pressing challenges.

        Throughout the 1990s Ted Robert Gurr developed and refined a model of ethnopolitical rebellion built around four key determinantsidentity, incentives, capacity, and opportunities. Lindström and Moore (1995), Gurr and Moore (1997), and Moore and Gurr (1998) have argued that the explanation Gurr proposes actually implies an interactive model in which these four factors, along with rebellion and repression, work interdependently to determine levels of rebellious ethnic conflict. In this study I utilize a three-stage least squares estimator to test the ability of this interactive model to explain the magnitude of ethnopolitical rebellion in the seventeen regions of Spain from 19771996. The use of an original event data set with enhanced indicators allows for the first test of Gurrs interactive model not based on the Minorities at Risk project, while the cross-temporal design facilitates the first full test of the models democracy-rebellion linkages. This test demonstrates even stronger overall support for the theoretical model than previous analyses, which had failed to find evidence for the direct influence of grievances on rebellion, of democratization and repression on mobilization, and of democracy on repression. An important deviation from Gurrs model is the finding that three of the proposed indicators of deprivationrelative regional GDP, education, and regional autonomywere found to have the opposite impact from that intended. Implications of these findings are explored in depth.

This test demonstrates even stronger overall support for the theoretical model than previous analyses, which had failed to find evidence for the direct influence of grievances on rebellion, of democratization and repression on mobilization, and of democracy on repression. An important deviation from Gurrs model is the finding that three of the proposed indicators of deprivationrelative regional GDP, education, and regional autonomywere found to have the opposite impact from that intended. Implications of these findings are explored in depth.},

        Objectives. This article examines the extent to which nonprofit organizational foundings are determined by various forms of social capital. Our hypothesis is that, controlling for other relevant social, political, and economic factors, communities with higher levels of social capital should experience more extensive growth in their nonprofit sectors. Methods. Using data derived from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey and the IRS &#8220;charitable organization&#8221; Business Master Files, we test our hypothesis using a negative binomial event count regression on nonprofit organization foundings in 284 U.S. counties in the year 2001. Results. We find that two core dimensions of social capital–-political engagement and &#8220;bridging&#8221; social ties–-have a significant impact on county-level nonprofit foundings. Surprisingly, a key element of social capital in the literature, the level of interpersonal trust, does not lead to an increase in foundings of new not-for-profit organizations. Conclusions. This study provides further evidence of the strength of political engagement and bridging ties for the vitality of the community. It also shows that the different dimensions of social capital do not manifest a uniform effect on nonprofit sector growth. These results further demonstrate that the growth of a community&#8217;s not-for-profit sector is dependent on a mix of ecological and environmental factors, especially preexisting organizational density, median household income, unemployment, and levels of governmental spending. Overall, social capital can usefully be seen as another key &#8220;environmental&#8221; factor in explanations of organizational foundings.

        This investigation involved in-depth analyses of 10 discrete dimensions of quality of life in Rochester, NY: urban sprawl, education, economy, cost of living, population health, health care services, public safety, transportation, taxation, and individual wealth & poverty. Changes in Rochester&#8217;s quality of life were tracked over time. In addition, Rochester&#8217;s performance was compared with that in 19 other comparable metropolitan areas throughout the country. Our analysis shows that, of the 20 regions, Rochester obtained the highest average overall score on the ten different dimensions of quality of life in 2004.

        Previous models of nationalism have been unable to adequately account for variation in forms or levels of contentious nationalist activity. Building on the most important theoretical tools from the literatures on social movements and nationalism, an alternative model is proposed in which structure, politics, and action assume equal roles in an interdependent causal system. It is further proposed that violent and nonviolent contention, though conceptually distinct phenomena, are the products of a fundamentally similar set of factors. The model posits that sociostructural `root causes&#8217; are vital to the development of ethnonationalist contentious politics, but indirectly via mobilization. The direct determinants of protest and rebellion are a conjunction of organizational mobilization and political opportunity structures. In particular, a shared identity gives groups of people the basis for organizational mobilization; mobilizational resources provide the means for such mobilization; grievances lend the reason; and a series of political factors structure the opportunities of mobilized groups to contend in a conventional, violent or nonviolent manner. The opportunity structures are then themselves transformed by the nature of the contention that takes place. Using a 3SLS structural equation model and original data from the 17 autonomous communities of Spain between 1977 and 1996, the results show that structure, politics, and action are, as predicted, three fundamental components of an interdependent causal system. The vital, yet indirect role of grievances and group identity in the generation of ethnonationalist conflict is confirmed, and a number of powerful relationships obtain with the individual elements of the political opportunity structure. Higher levels of democracy are related to increased protest, more intense repression is associated with lower levels of contentious activity, and the level of regional autonomy has no apparent impact on conflict. In the short term, moreover, Spain&#8217;s major democratic transition is shown to exacerbate existing conflict propensities.

        Analyses of the determinants of anti-immigrant hostility remain underdeveloped in the literature. Current research is diminished by competing claims over the primacy of economic, ideological, contextual, or socio-demographic factors. To consolidate past research and work towards a more coherent theory of attitudinal hostility, we argue that it is first necessary to disaggregate the broad notion of hostility into social and policy hostility. We use the 30th Eurobarometer on Immigrants and Outgroups to test the ability of the economic vulnerability, ideology, and national context arguments to explain levels of socially and politically hostile attitudes to immigrants in five countries of the European Union. The results confirm that not only are social and policy hostility distinct, but ideological factors &#8211; both new and old &#8211; provide a more cogent account of hostility than either economics or national context. The study finds that attitudinal hostility fundamentally derives from a conjunction of low levels of education and a powerful form of ideological hostility that encompasses old-fashioned racism, traditional right-wing ideology, and materialist value orientations.

The authors argue that in the wake of follow-on initiatives, a protracted recessionary period, and the state&#8217;s use of newly authorized revenue-transfer powers, this still-evolving regime entered a new phase in the 1990s. This article analyzes the primary impacts of and responses to the changes in California&#8217;s post-Proposition 13 fiscal regime in the 1990s in five local jurisdictions. The results reveal that the most significant long-term impacts of this regime have been an altered fiscal structure and an unintended decrease in local home rule. These impacts, in turn, have led to cuts in nonessential services, the expansion of sales tax-generating redevelopment efforts, implementation of new taxes and user service fees, and increased reliance on one-time fiscal measures.
