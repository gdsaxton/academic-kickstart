Previously I was Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at the University at Buffalo and in the Department of Public Administration at SUNY-Brockport.

My research focuses on data analytic approaches to nonprofit accounting and CSR. More broadly, I study the role and effects of technology &#8212; especially Big Data and social media &#8212; on the flow of information to and from organizations. I focus on nonprofit organizations but also have an interest in financial markets and corporate social responsibility. 

You can see my slightly out-of-date <a href="http://social-metrics.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV here</a>. To see a list of deliverables of my research, feel free to browse through my peer-reviewed [publications][1] or visit my <a href="http://ssrn.com/author=1100547" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SSRN page</a>.

One of the goals of this blog is to build on this research and provide practical advice to organizations seeking to strategically deploy new and social media resources. I am also a proponent of using Python to gather, process, analyze, and visualize information. For this reason, I will also use this blog to share information, documentation, how-to&#8217;s, and code. My hope is that this proves useful to fellow academics as well as budding data scientists wherever they may be.
